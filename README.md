# spotify-valence
An app to determine how upbeat or downbeat my playlists have been. 
This is a project idea I came up with when I was interviewing for a data journalism role in 2020. 
I'm currenlty on mat leave at the moment and wanted to have a little hobby coder project to dust off some old skills I had. 

In the Read Me, I'll diarise my progress with this project.

I'm enjoying getting back into coding. But I also realised, "Do I even need to do this if ChatGPT can just write code for me?"

Am realising I have lots of gaps in my coding knowledge, such as "Why do we even need Express?" and "How can I grab a piece of data from nested arrays and objects?".

I'm continuing on anyways, because I believe that ramming my head into the nuts and bolts of what I'm trying to do will result in a better understanding of APIs, and how to navigate complex data structures. 

And I also realised the idea I had, to find a valence for a playlist, isn't quite possible from a Spotify API, I'd be averaging all the valence values from the tracks on a playlist, is that even a reasonable thing to do to evaluate if a playlist is happy or sad? 

On a happier note, I'm satisfied with how easy picking Git back up has been. My eyes did glaze over when I looked at merge via recursive strategy but its also late at night (for me) and I'm not really comprehending clearly.
